site deploys here:   https://plantidapp.netlify.app

## Technologies Used
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Basic structure and styling.
- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Redux Toolkit**: For state management.
- **AJAX**: To fetch data from an external API.

## Approach
This project uses React and Redux Toolkit to create a plant search application. The application allows users to search for plants and view care instructions. It utilizes AJAX to fetch plant data from an external API.

## Usage Instructions
1. Search for a plant using the search bar.
2. View plant care information displayed as cards.

## Unsolved Problems
- Handling error states if the API fetch fails.
- Improving the UI/UX for better responsiveness.

## Future Improvements
- Add filters for plant types.
- Implement user authentication for personalized features.
